# Need For Speed: Ignitiion

"Need for Speed: Ignition" is a simple car racing game developed as a first-semester C++ project. This game introduces players to the thrilling experience, where they control a car to avoid obstacles and make a hightscore. The project was designed to showcase fundamental programming skills, game logic, and creativity, all while providing an engaging and fun gaming experience.

## How it Works: 
1. The game initializes with a menu section where user can either start, select a car or change the settings.
2. After selecting a car, the user chooses a map. 
3. The player navigates a car using keyboard inputs (e.g., arrow keys).
4. Obstacles (i.e. Cars) appear randomly on the screen, moving toward the player.
5. The player earns points for successfully avoiding obstacles.
6. The player has 10 lives, and for each collision a live is deducted. After all the 10 lives are used, the game ends. The game also ends when the user runs out of the fuel. 
7. After the game has ended, the game displays the player's score, time survived, cause of lose, and a menu to restart or continue from the last checkpoint. 

## Challenges Faced: 
1. Designing collision detection logic for the car and obstacles.
2. Implementing dynamic speed adjustments to increase difficulty.
3. Ensuring smooth and responsive controls.

## Learning Outcomes: 
1. Gained practical experience in object-oriented programming (OOP).
2. Applied concepts like loops, conditionals, vectors and arrays.
3. Enhanced problem-solving and debugging skills.
4. Learned basic game mechanics and UI design.
